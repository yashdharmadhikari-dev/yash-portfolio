      <h3>Video Summary using AI</h3>
      <p><em>(T.E Capstone Project)</em></p>
    
      <img src="video-summary.jpeg" alt="Diagram" class="diagram">
    
      <p><b>Description:</b> The Video Summary using AI is a cutting-edge web application designed to automatically generate concise and accurate summaries of long videos. By leveraging advanced models like the Bi-modal Transformer (BMT) and OpenAI's Whisper model, the system provides seamless and efficient video summarization, making content more digestible and time-efficient for users. This application is ideal for summarizing educational videos, corporate meetings, webinars, and more, significantly reducing the time users need to extract key insights from video content.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Developed the core architecture for real-time video analysis and transcription, reducing manual processing time by 60%.</li>
        <li>Utilized OpenAI's Whisper model to achieve a transcription accuracy of 94%, ensuring high-quality summaries even for noisy environments.</li>
        <li>Implemented the Bi-modal Transformer (BMT) for multi-modal data processing, combining video and audio inputs, improving summarization accuracy by 87% compared to traditional text-based methods.</li>
        <li>Optimized the BMT model to handle large video files (over 2 hours) with a 45% reduction in memory usage, ensuring smooth and fast performance on web browsers.</li>
        <li>Integrated automatic language detection, expanding the application's usability across 15 different languages, with an accuracy improvement of 90%.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with cloud storage services to ensure scalable video processing, improving data retrieval speed by 50%.</li>
