        <h2>Generating Textual Video Summaries using Modified Bi-Modal Transformer and Whisper Model</h2>
        <p><strong>Published In:</strong> 2023 International Conference on Advanced Computing Technologies and Applications (ICACTA)</p>
        <p><strong>Date of Conference:</strong> 06-07 October 2023, Mumbai, India</p>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhesh Madkaikar, Vipul Belhekar, Yash Dharmadhikari, Amiya Kumar Tripathy</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
            Online video material availability has grown significantly over the past few years, making it challenging for viewers to consume and process information effectively. 
            Video summaries written in text form have shown to be a helpful technique for solving this problem. The purpose of the model is to display a short textual summary 
            of the video to the user before the user watches the complete video. This can be useful in various tasks such as video content moderation and assisting visually-impaired users.
